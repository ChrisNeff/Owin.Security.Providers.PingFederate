You need to have the OAuth2 module enabled, configure Clients, configure mappings, poliecies, adapters, etc. Everything is explained in the PingFederate documentation. If you have problems or questions contact me using the Issues tab.\r\n\r\nSamples have been added, please refer to them to get an idea on how to set up the Middleware. Also refer to the main project page for an step by step.\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is add a reference to the package using Nuget and add the following to your **Startup.Auth.cs** class \r\n\r\n    public partial class Startup\r\n      {\r\n          public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)\r\n          {\r\n              // Enable the application to use a cookie to store information for the signed in user\r\n              app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions\r\n              {\r\n                  AuthenticationType = DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie,\r\n                  LoginPath = new PathString(\"/Account/Login\")\r\n              });\r\n              \r\n              app.UsePingFederateAuthentication(new PingFederateAuthenticationOptions()\r\n              {\r\n                  ClientId = \"id\",\r\n                  ClientSecret = \"super_secret\",\r\n                  PingFederateUrl = \"https://your-ping-federate-server.com\",\r\n                  SignInAsAuthenticationType = DefaultAuthenticationTypes.ApplicationCookie,\r\n              });\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      \r\n\r\n## NuGet\r\n\r\nDownload the NuGet package [here](http://bit.ly/OpenIDConnect)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-57230090-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
